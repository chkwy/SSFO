Where am I going to live? Have I got somewhere where I can see my daughter.\"\n\"You're put out among the same sort of people doing the same sort of thing, and it's difficult, it's difficult to get away from it.

{"document": "The regulator has agreed to increase the amount of weight graphite bricks at the core of the reactor at Dungeness B in Kent will be allowed to lose.\nThe bricks, which degrade over time due to radiation, are vital for safety.\nThe Office for Nuclear Regulation said it was a \"robust\" body but one expert accused it of \"moving the goalposts\".\nThe nuclear reactor at Dungeness B would have breached the safety margin within months which could have forced the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) to prosecute or even shut it down.\nThe safety margins cover thousands of graphite bricks at the core of Britain's 14 elderly Advanced Gas-cooled Reactors (AGRs).\nBut the bricks, each about a metre in height, are both cracking and starting to lose weight due to decades of radiation, and that could affect safety.\nThe current graphite weight loss limit for Dungeness is set at 6.2% but the regulator says when it reached 5.7% its operator, French power giant EDF, applied to raise it to 8%.\nMark Foy, deputy chief inspector at the Office for Nuclear Regulation, said \"We will be in a position to agree that 8% limit within the next few weeks. Ageing is a nuclear safety issue\".\nAs part of that ageing process the licensee was required to monitor and inspect the reactors regularly.\nSteve Thomas, professor of energy policy at the University of Greenwich, said: \"It doesn't feel good when we come up against limits and the first thing they [the ONR] do is to move the goalposts.\"\nMr Foy stressed that the ONR was a \"robust regulator\" and due process had been followed.\n\"If we feel the evidence they [EDF] have supplied is robust and sufficient to underpin the 8% case then we will agree it,\" he said.\nThe graphite bricks are integral to UK nuclear power stations and they act to moderate the nuclear reaction; it will not function without them.\nThe bricks cannot be replaced which means they are being carefully monitored as the reactors age. They become damaged through years of intense bombardment by radiation and effects of the coolant CO2 on the material.\nA distortion to the graphite core could prevent the control rods being inserted, which shut down the reactor in an emergency.\nEDF said \"safety of the public and our employees is our overriding priority\" and the company took a \"cautious approach\" working closely with the regulator and they operated with \"very conservative safety margins\" and safety requirements were \"stringent\".\nBut in shifting the graphite limit Dungeness can still run only until the start of 2020 but that is still three years fewer than EDF would like and it may have to request a second increase in the safety limit.\nProf Paul Mummery, from Manchester University, agreed that the original limits were \"conservative.\"\nBut he said the twin problems of graphite cracking and weight loss meant it may be \"uneconomic\" for EDF to keep all the 14 AGR reactors running in the long term because the regulator may insist on more inspections to demonstrate safety.\n\"They [EDF] are making good progress but I would not be able to say with absolute confidence that they will reach 2023,\" he said.\nIt was an \"engineering judgement\", he said, but \"no one could be sure\".\n\"There was more weight loss than expected in Dungeness B and that has led to some uncertainty about the continued operation.\"\nThe AGR reactors contribute about 15% of Britain's electricity, according to Prof Thomas.\nHe said EDF wanted the old AGR reactors to last until the planned next generation of nuclear power stations came on line after 2023 but said it was reaching a \"crunch point\".\nThe old reactors might not last as long as EDF would like and there were still real doubts about the plans to build the new reactor at Hinkley C in Somerset.", "summary": "A key safety limit at one of Britain's nuclear power stations is being raised to allow the life of the reactor to be extended, the BBC has learned.", "id": "27691207"}

It's full of eccentric and downright misleading reports,\" said Prof Bryan Sykes, from Oxford University.\nThe researchers will apply a systematic approach and employ the latest advances in genetic testing, aiming to publish in peer-reviewed scientific journals.\n\"There have been DNA tests done on alleged yetis and other such things but since then the testing techniques, particularly on hair, have improved a lot due to advances in forensic science,\" the Oxford geneticist told Reuters news agency.\nModern testing could get valid results from a fragment of a shaft of hair, added Prof Sykes, who is leading the project with Michel Sartori, director of the Lausanne Museum of Zoology.\nA 1951 expedition to Mount Everest famously returned with photographs of giant footprints in the snow, fuelling speculation about giant Himalayan creatures, unknown to science.\nSince then, many eye-witness reports of such creatures have emerged from remote regions of the world.\nThese humanoid beasties are variously known as the \"yeti\" or \"migoi\" in the Himalayas, \"bigfoot\" or \"sasquatch\" in North America, \"almasty\" in the Caucasus mountains and \"orang pendek\" in Sumatra, but there are many others.\nTests up to now have usually concluded that alleged yeti remains were in fact human. But, said Prof Sykes, \"there has been no systematic review of this material.\"\nThe project will focus on an archive of remains held at the Lausanne museum that was assembled by Bernard Heuvelmans, a Belgian-French biologist who investigated reported yeti sightings from 1950 up to his death in 2001.\nOther institutions and individuals will also be asked to send in details of any possible yeti material.\nAside from the yeti question, Prof Sykes said he hoped the project would add to the growing body of knowledge on the interaction between different human species in the past.\n\"In the last two years it has become clear that there was considerable interbreeding between  \n          Homo sapiens and Neanderthals ... about 2% to 4% of the DNA of each individual European is Neanderthal,\" he said.\nThose who are favourable to the idea of as-yet undescribed creatures say the yeti and orang pendek could represent survivals of  \n          Homo erectus,  \n          Homo floresiensis (the Indonesian \"Hobbit\") or  \n          Gigantopithecus - a giant ape that once inhabited the forests of East Asia. The idea has even spawned the term \"cryptozoology\" to describe the search for such beasts.\nOthers are highly sceptical of such tales, and consider the subject unworthy of serious scientific investigation.\nAsked about the project's chances of success, Prof Sykes said: \"The answer is, of course, I don't know,\" adding, \"it's unlikely, but on the other hand if we don't examine it we won't know.\"", "summary": "A UK-Swiss team will use DNA testing to investigate the origins of remains claimed to be from yeti and bigfoot.", "id": "18160673"}

{"document": "The finding deals a significant blow to the theory of physics known as supersymmetry.\nMany researchers had hoped the LHC would have confirmed this by now.\nSupersymmetry, or Susy, has gained popularity as a way to explain some of the inconsistencies in the traditional theory of subatomic physics known as the Standard Model.\nThe new observation, reported at the Hadron Collider Physics conference in Kyoto and outlined in an as-yet unpublished paper, is not consistent with many of the most likely models of Susy.\nProf Chris Parkes, who is the spokesperson for the UK participation in the LHCb experiment, told BBC News: \"Supersymmetry may not be dead but these latest results have certainly put it into hospital.\"\nSupersymmetry theorises the existence of more massive versions of particles that have already been detected.\nIf found, they might help explain the phenomenon known as dark matter. Galaxies appear to rotate faster at their edges than the matter we see can account for, and one set of candidates for this missing dark matter is supersymmetric particles.\nHowever, researchers at the LHCb detector have dealt a serious blow to hopes of finding them.\nThey have measured the decay between a particle known as a Bs meson into two particles known as muons. It is the first time that this decay has ever been observed, and the team has calculated that for every billion times that the Bs meson decays it only decays in this way three times.\nIf superparticles were to exist, the decay would happen far more often. This experiment is one of the \"golden\" tests for supersymmetry, and it would appear that this hugely popular theory among physicists has failed.\nThe result is at a statistical level of \"3.5 sigma\" - meaning that there is a one-in-4300 chance that the team would see the same \"bump\" in their data if the decay were not happening. This level makes the find worth further investigation, but falls well short of the 5-sigma level of certainty required for a formal discovery.\nProf Val Gibson, leader of the Cambridge University LHCb team, said that the new result was \"putting our supersymmetry theory colleagues in a spin\".\nThe results are in fact completely in line with what one would expect from the Standard Model. There is already concern that the LHCb's sister detectors might have expected to have detected superparticles by now, yet none has been found so far.\nIf supersymmetry is not an explanation for dark matter, then theorists will have to find alternative ideas to explain those inconsistencies in the Standard Model. So far researchers who are racing to find evidence of so called \"new physics\" have run into a series of dead ends.\n\"If new physics exists, then it is hiding very well behind the Standard Model,\" commented Cambridge physicist Dr Marc-Olivier Bettler, a member of the analysis team.\nThe result does not rule out the possibility that super particles exist.

{"document": "Wales in the 13th Century was a mixture of regional powers. By the middle of the previous century, most of the lowland areas, particularly in south Wales, were under English control, in the form of Anglo-Norman barons from the Marches and across Glamorganshire to Pembroke.\nGwynedd and the north-west of Wales remained largely independent. Welsh princes acknowledged the ruler Llywelyn the Great and his successor Llywelyn ap Gruffudd as the overarching Prince of Wales. But as the century wore away, and Edward I of England came to power, the balance of power changed as Llywelyn refused to pay tribute to Edward.\nIn 1276 Edward I led an invasion into Gwynedd and forced Llywelyn into the very top corner of the country, and set about his castle-building programme. An uprising in 1282 led to renewed fighting, and saw the death of Llywelyn. By the following year it was over, and English domination over Wales was entrenched. Edward's son, the future Edward II, was created Prince of Wales.\nAt the start of the 1200s, Welsh was the language of the common people.\nIt was how people did business, conducted family life and worshipped. By the end of the century, daily business was increasingly done in English.\nEnglish settlers were encouraged to move to Wales by free land grants and the imposition of English law.\nAs the settlers moved into the more fruitful lowlands, Welsh speakers were increasingly pushed to the higher ground, although there was crossover between the two.\nOne of the main changes through the course of the 13th Century was the difference in the way people paid for things.\nAccording to Dr Mark Redknap, head of collections and research in the history department at the Museum of Welsh Life, the old system of \"render\" was starting to change.\n\"It's fair to say that from about the end of the 13th Century the Welsh were more familiar with using money than they had been a century earlier,\" he said.\n\"You had an increasing use of coinage whereas there is very much a barter economy with the pre-Norman period, and payment in kind.\"\nHe said taxes to the English king were paid in cash. Coinage though was still more at the stage where the actual weight of the coins, in silver for example, was what provided the value rather than a nominal amount printed on the coin.\nAs well as tithes paid to the church, Llywelyn had tried to levy tax on cattle and in lieu of military service. But it was Edward I who pushed formalised tax collection.\nBy the time of his death in 1307, tax revenue from Wales had tripled.\nAccording to Gerald of Wales, the Welsh were a militaristic society, more concerned with learning to fight rather than ploughing their land more than necessary.\nBut this only applied to free men: about a third of the population at the start of the century were bonded to a lord and worked for them on large estates.\nThe common people wore simple clothes: a tunic and thin cloak.\nAlthough much of Wales was rural, with large forests being an important source of food and resources for many, fledgling towns had been established by the Normans in places like Carmarthen and Cardiff and by the end of the century there were around 90 small towns, although few had populations over 1,000.\nIt is worth remembering that the population of Wales was tiny in comparison to now, with the whole population equivalent to modern-day Cardiff.\nSources: BBC History; St Fagans National History Museum; The People of Wales ed Gareth Elwyn Jones and Dai Smith", "summary": "As the Welsh government publishes plans to reintroduce Welsh taxes for the first time since the 13th century, BBC News looks at what life was like in Wales last time there was direct Welsh taxation.", "id": "29324237"}

Cut off from help, it was only a matter of time, perhaps, for the rebels.\nThere are other parts of Homs still, just, in rebel hands. But if they, along with Khalidiya, do fall, Homs will become just the latest in a line of regime victories on the battlefield.\nThe regime's forces have been steadily picking off some of the villages around Homs. Two months ago, with the help of Hezbollah, they recaptured the town of Qusair. The government has halted - if not quite turned around - a rebel advance on Damascus.

They then monitored the change in the height of the overlying water during the course of 201 days.\nWhat the scientists saw was a clear spike in the data twice a day - the result of the gravitational pull of the Moon and Sun. But they could also tease out a second signal stemming from the way water rises and falls as a result of the tilting of the land. And, in fact, the latter effect sits on top of the first and is responsible for most of the amplitude change.\nThe team says the measurement was made to an accuracy of just 0.1 mm over the loch's 35 km length.\n\"We had to extract the tidal signal and get rid of all the noise. This involved very high precision,\" explained David Pugh.\n\"For example, the loch surface itself goes up and down every day by four centimetres just due to the pump storage scheme for hydroelectric generation, and we have to pull out a very small signal within that.\n\"The holy grail would be to learn from the effects of the tides something about the Earth's crust.  So the more precise we can get, the more we may learn about the crust.\"\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter", "summary": "Scientists have measured the way Loch Ness tilts back and forth as the whole of Scotland bends with the passing of the tides.", "id": "16394421"}

Instead, his team had asked the authorities what the process of using lighter gloves entailed.\nAt the time, NAC executive director Bob Bennett told BBC Sport he had never seen a move to 8oz gloves at 154lbs before.\nRules state that 10oz gloves are used from 135lbs upwards but bouts between 135lbs and 147lbs can use 8oz gloves if waivers are signed and the NAC feels the move is justified.\n\"Even if they are both in agreement, our number one policy is the health and safety of the fighters,\" said Bennett. \"To deviate from our regulations at a difference of 7lbs would be for the chairman and commissioners to determine.\"\nDuring his UFC career, McGregor has used 4oz gloves and he welcomed Mayweather's Instagram post last week, stating: \"I am coming sprinting at you with bricks. Know that. Brittle hands.\"\nThe NAC will debate the matter publicly before announcing its decision.\nMcGregor, 29, will make his boxing debut in what could be the richest fight in history. The UFC lightweight champion's move from the octagon to the ring to face Mayweather, 40, has prompted criticism from major boxing personalities such as Oscar De La Hoya and Gennady Golovkin.\nBut Bennett says he studied a \"litany of information\" on the Irishman before telling his chairman there were \"several reasons to approve the fight\".\nBennett said that McGregor's UFC rival Nate Diaz played a role in him forming his opinion.\n\"I spoke to Virgil Hunter, who trains many top fighters and has worked with the likes of Andre Ward,\" said Bennett. \"He used Nate Diaz a dozen times for sparring and said he rated him as an outstanding boxer.\n\"Then you put Nate in the ring with Conor and Conor knocks him down with several shots. Add in that Conor has a granite-like chin, add in that he's 12 years younger than Floyd, and add in that he's taller and longer.\n\"Floyd is probably one of the smartest fighters, he has the art of getting in getting shots and getting out.

There are a lot of others out there but most people don't know they exist or don't have any interest in them because GoPro has become such a dominant name that it is 'the action brand' as far as they are concerned.\"\nThe risk for the firm, he added, was that other drone manufacturers would opt to partner with other camera makers to avoid supporting a competitor.\nThe world's bestselling commercial drone maker - China's DJI - has already decided to limit initial sales of its Phantom 3 flagship to a design that features its own proprietary video camera.\nThe previous generation had been launched instead with an optional mount for GoPro cams.\nMr Woodman said he planned to release the GoPro drone within the first half of 2016, and that it would be targeted at consumers.\n\"Quadcopters have a special place for us at GoPro because I was a huge radio-controlled plane enthusiast as a kid and I could never really get anyone involved in it with me because it was either too geeky or it took a lot of time to learn how to fly these things - you'd crash them all the time,\" he said.\n\"So, I was really surprised to see how quickly the general consumer was adopting quadcopters.\n\"Quads plus GoPro has been one of the most democratising combinations in terms of enabling people to capture professional quality content and see themselves in their environment in a way that they'd never seen before. It looks like you're in your own movie.\"\nDrones are expected to be one of the fastest growing electronics sectors over the coming years.\nAccording to the US's Consumer Electronics Association, the global market for consumer drones totalled $84m (\u00c2\u00a354m) last year but is forecast to top $300m by 2018. The CEA adds that if regulators relax the rules for the use of such aircraft by commercial organisations, the market could further swell to $1bn by 2020.\nThat could represent a lucrative new market for GoPro.\nThe firm's existing cameras and other accessories generated $363m of sales over the first three months of 2015. That was up 54% on the previous year, but resulted in a relatively slim net profit of $16.8m.\nMr Woodman also showed off a prototype mount that can hold six of his firm's Hero4 cameras, each pointing in a different direction.\nHe said the resulting footage could be stitched together using software developed by Kolor - a start-up it bought last month - to create a single 6K-quality 360-degree image.\nThis could then be used with virtual reality helmets - allowing a user to change their perspective by turning their head left and right and looking up and down - or via YouTube and Facebook, which are both adding support for interactive spherical videos.\nThe Six-Camera Spherical Array add-on will go on sale later this year.\nMr Woodman acknowledged, however, that the high cost of buying enough cameras to fill it was likely to limit the mount's appeal to professionals.\nAt a subsequent event, Google also announced a more elaborate virtual reality capture device, which involves 16 GoPro cameras, as part of a tie-up between the two companies.\nThe footage produced by the Jump camera array will be processed by the search firm's own software to produce panoramas, rather than spherical videos, that make use of depth data deduced by Google's algorithms.", "summary": "GoPro's chief executive has confirmed it will make its own quadcopter drones.", "id": "32915014"}

That is slowly beginning to have an effect.\nBut never has there been a suggestion that the US would renege on its responsibilities.\nHis comments on Turkey suggest that the Republican contender also seems reluctant to insist upon Nato members maintaining strong democratic principles.\nMr Trump's positions will be seen by Washington's Nato partners as at best eccentric and at worst alarming.\nAt a time of growing tensions with Moscow, the idea that the US might become an unreliable ally is a nightmare for Nato's European members.\nAsked about Russian aggression towards Nato countries in the Baltic region, Mr Trump suggested the US might abandon the longstanding protections offered by the US to such nations.\nThe divisive Republican candidate also said that, if elected, he would not pressure US allies over crackdowns on political opposition and civil liberties, arguing that the US had to \"fix our own mess\" before \"lecturing\" other nations.\nHe said: \"Look at what is happening in our country. How are we going to lecture when people are shooting policemen in cold blood?\"\nAsked about the failed coup in Turkey on Friday, the Republican candidate praised Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has been criticised by some Western leaders over his increasingly authoritarian rule.\n\"I give great credit to him for being able to turn that around,\" Mr Trump said of the failed coup. \"Some people say that it was staged, you know that,\" he said. \"I don't think so.\"\nUS Secretary of State John Kerry has urged Mr Erdogan to follow the rule of law, amid a crackdown on opposition figures by the Turkish leader in the wake of the coup attempt.

{"document": "Carbon is the key ingredient for all life on our planet.\nBut how Earth acquired its \"volatile elements\" - which have low boiling points - such as carbon and sulphur remains a subject of some debate.\nA team now argues that a collision between Earth and an embryonic planet like Mercury could provide the answer.\nDetails of the work appear in the journal Nature Geoscience.\n\"The challenge is to explain the origin of the volatile elements like carbon that remain outside the core in the mantle portion of our planet,\" said Rajdeep Dasgupta, a co-author of the study from Rice University in Houston, Texas.\nAccording to a widely accepted idea called the Late Veneer Hypothesis, Earth formed from material that was largely devoid of volatiles. These elements, such as carbon, sulphur, nitrogen and hydrogen, were added later on by space rocks after Earth's core had finished forming.\n\"Any of those elements that fell to Earth in meteorites and comets more than about 100 million years after the Solar System formed could have avoided the intense heat of the magma ocean that covered Earth up to that point,\" said Yuan Li, from the Guangzhou Institute of Geochemistry at the Chinese Academy of Sciences.\n\"The problem with that idea is that while it can account for the abundance of many of these elements, there are no known meteorites that would produce the ratio of volatile elements in the silicate portion of our planet.\"\nThe group had previously published papers showing that if even if carbon had not vaporised into space when the planet was largely molten, it would have ended up in the metallic core of our planet - because the iron-rich alloys there have a strong affinity for carbon.\nBut if this is the case, where did the carbon in the mantle and biosphere come from?\nThe team used laboratory experiments that can recreate the high-pressure and high-temperature conditions that exist deep inside Earth and other rocky planets.\nThe found that one scenario that could reconcile the discrepancies in the carbon-to-sulphur ratio and carbon abundance was an embryonic planet like Mercury colliding with and being absorbed by Earth, early in its history.\n\"Because it's a massive body, the dynamics could work in a way that the core of that planet would go directly to the core of our planet, and the carbon-rich mantle would mix with Earth's mantle,\" said Dr Dasgupta.", "summary": "Much of Earth's life-giving carbon could have been delivered in a planetary collision about 4.4 billion years ago, a theory suggests.", "id": "37276218"}

With the right equipment, it is possible to see dark regions called sunspots. But up close, our Sun is a dynamic, violent beast.\nBright loops of matter arch and twist like fiery fountains above the surface of this gigantic natural nuclear reactor. And every so often an intense burst of radiation called a solar flare appears when magnetic energy - stored in our star's atmosphere - is suddenly released.\nSolar flares are sometimes associated with the release of high energy particles into space - eruptions that are known as coronal mass ejections (CMEs), though these can also occur on their own.\nA large CME can contain billions of tonnes of gas and other matter that pours into space at several million km per hour. The charged particles in this cloud stream towards any planet or spacecraft in its path.\nWhen these particles collide with the Earth, they can cause a geomagnetic storm - a disturbance in the magnetic sheath (or magnetosphere) that surrounds our planet, protecting its denizens from the worst effects of cosmic rays.\nMany of the effects of charged particles hitting the Earth's magnetosphere are benign, such as polar lights - the Aurora borealis and australis.\nGeomagnetic storms - often referred to as solar storms - cause these northern or southern lights to become visible at lower latitudes.\nHowever, they also disrupt technology on Earth, such as communications systems - including those used by aircraft, satellite navigation signals and electrical power grids.\nAs such, they could wreak long-lasting havoc with communications and power infrastructure across the globe.\nA 2008 report by the US National Academy of Sciences concluded that an extreme storm could cause up to $2 trillion in initial damages by crippling communications on Earth and causing chaos around the world.\nAs such, several agencies around the world are working to better understand the changing conditions near our planet - known collectively as space weather.\nForecasters at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Space Weather Prediction Center monitor activity using data from a network of sensors, including those on satellites, and US Geological Survey instruments that detect magnetic fields (magnetometers).\nThe Sun goes through cycles of high and low activity that repeat approximately every 11 years. It is currently gaining in activity and is expected to peak in 2013 or 2014, although nobody can be sure.\nThis means we can expect more solar flares and more coronal mass ejections over the next few years. The solar cycle we're currently in has been a relatively quiet one in compared with previous ones.\nBut that does not mean that there could not be a large event in the build up to the next \"solar maximum\".\nYes. In 1994, a solar storm caused major malfunctions to two communications satellites, disrupting television and radio services throughout Canada.\nIn March 1989, another event caused the Hydro-Quebec power grid in Canada to go down for over nine hours. The resulting damages and loss in revenue were estimated to be in the region of hundreds of millions of dollars.\nBut the most significant historic event remains the great solar storm of 1-2 September 1859. This disturbance shorted telegraph wires, starting fires in North America and Europe, and caused bright aurorae to be seen in Cuba and Hawaii.\nIn 1859, our technological infrastructure was in its infancy, but a storm with the magnitude of the so-called Carrington Event would be much more damaging today.\nPaul.Rincon-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk", "summary": "Solar storms are a natural occurrence caused by high-energy particles hitting the Earth.", "id": "17301956"}

{"document": "After centuries as a powerful medieval kingdom, Hungary was part of the Ottoman and then Habsburg empires from the 16th century onwards, emerging as an independent country again after World War I.\nThe Hungarian language belongs to the Finno-Ugric family and is one of the handful of languages spoken within the European Union that are not of Indo-European origin.\nA landlocked country, Hungary is home to Lake Balaton, the largest in central Europe, and to a large number of spa towns and hot springs.\nCountry profiles compiled by BBC Monitoring\nIt has especially rich traditions in folk and classical music and was the birthplace of numerous outstanding performers and composers, including Franz Liszt, Bela Bartok and Zoltan Kodaly.\nHungary became co-equal partner with Austria in a dual monarchy in the mid-19th century after an unsuccessful revolt against the Habsburgs in 1848. After a period of turmoil following World War I, an independent kingdom of Hungary was established under the authoritarian regency of Admiral Miklos Horthy.\nThe redrawing of European borders that took place after World War I left about five million ethnic Hungarians living in neighbouring countries. Their status remains a sensitive issue and has complicated Hungary's relations with its neighbours.\nFollowing World War II, in which Admiral Horthy had allied himself with Germany, Hungary fell under communist rule. An uprising in 1956 was crushed by Red Army forces, but Hungary did later become the first Eastern European country to gain some economic freedom.\nHungary played an important part in accelerating the collapse of communism across Eastern Europe when it opened its border with Austria in 1989, allowing thousands of East Germans to escape to the West. Just a few months later the Berlin Wall was history.\nHungary's post-communist economic transition was achieved relatively smoothly. Within four years of the collapse of communism nearly half of the country's economic enterprises had been transferred to the private sector, and by 1998 Hungary was attracting nearly half of all foreign direct investment in Central Europe.\nTen years later, the picture looked rather less rosy. A high level of both private and state borrowing left the country particularly vulnerable to the credit crunch of 2008, and in October of that year the government was forced to appeal to the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank for massive loans in a bid to stave off economic collapse.\nDissatisfaction with the centre-left coalition government's handling of the economy from 2002 to 2010 coincided with the rise of the right-wing nationalist party Jobbik, known for its anti-Semitic and anti-Gypsy rhetoric, and a move to the authoritarian right by the Fidesz party, which won parliamentary elections in 2010 and 2014.\nThe two-thirds parliamentary majority gained by Fidesz in 2010 allowed it to throw out the comparatively liberal post-communist constitution and replace it with a constitution that critics say cements the governing party's hold on power and removes checks and balances essential for the healthy functioning of a democracy. Fidesz insists that the constitutional change was necessary in order to complete the work of eradicating the legacy of communism.\nFidesz scored another comfortable victory in the 2014 election, albeit with a reduced majority.

{"document": "A period of uncertainty over political leadership after the announcement that David Cameron would quit has not made the mandarins' lives any easier. One familiar and important issue has bubbled up to the surface again - NHS finances.\nThe fraught task of finalising the Department of Health's accounts for the last financial year is close to completion. Sources indicate it's touch and go as to whether the department kept to its spending limit agreed by parliament for the health service in England.\nAn overspend would be a serious breach of Whitehall protocol and lead to senior officials being hauled over the coals by the National Audit Office.\nMinisters and the leadership of the NHS in England are determined to demonstrate they have got a grip on the finances. To that end, a major initiative is planned involving commitments by all trusts in England to stick to agreed spending limits.\nThe regulator, NHS Improvement, under pressure from the government, is straining every sinew to bring down the \u00c2\u00a32.4bn total deficit racked up by trusts in the last financial year. Putting finance directors' feet to the fire and extracting pledges to stay on budget has been the priority in recent weeks.\nThe NHS financial announcement is likely next week and could well come on the same day as the publication of the Department of Health accounts. The government line will be that running up unplanned deficits and risking breaches of limits set by parliament will be no longer acceptable.\nAt a conference organised by the Reform think tank, the Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt talked of the need to \"restore financial discipline\".\nHe said that trusts should not assume there was a choice between maintaining patient care standards and controlling their finances and that the two were not incompatible. Mr Hunt argued that the hospital trusts with the best ratings by the Care Quality Commission tended to be those with the lowest deficits.\nBut announcing commitments to prudent spending is one thing, delivering them is another.  Once winter and the second half of the financial year arrives, the pressures will mount.\nIt's hard to see what sanctions can be applied to trust managements who feel they have to go over their agreed budgets to meet relentlessly increasing demand for patient care.\nAt some hospital trusts, the inevitable consequence of sticking to agreed spending totals will be longer waiting lists.\nLooking longer term, the referendum has raised more questions about the sustainability of NHS finances.\nThe head of NHS England, Simon Stevens, has called for politicians from either side of the referendum campaign to ensure that pledges for a better funded NHS made during the campaign are delivered. But it will be harder to hold out the begging bowl to the Treasury.\nThe Health Foundation think tank has pointed out that the public finances will be under even greater pressure with economists revising down short-term economic growth forecasts in the wake of the Brexit vote.\nAnita Charlesworth of the Foundation made the point that when the economy sneezes the NHS catches cold and that the service's finances were already \"in a truly dire state\".\nMinisters argue that the government has already made a significant commitment to funding above the rate of inflation for the NHS at a time when other parts of Whitehall are being severely squeezed.\nThey say that making better use of resources, through greater efficiency, is well within the capability of most trusts. But as the NHS celebrates its 68th birthday, the question marks over financial sustainability are perhaps as big as they ever have been.\nHow things will look when the service celebrates its landmark 70th anniversary is anyone's guess.", "summary": "After prolonged debate during the referendum, Whitehall has been busy since polling day trying to work out the implications of Brexit - including how the NHS could be affected.", "id": "36740661"}

Gary Megson and Owen Coyle could not halt the slide.\nDougie Freedman could not secure a play-off berth in Bolton's first season as a Championship club and was replaced by Neil Lennon in October 2014.\nDespite Davies agreeing to write off the club's debts as he looks for a way out, Bolton's financial situation has been described by Birch as \"critical\".\nThat is the legacy Gartside has left.\nSadly for him, it will be some time before Bolton fans can look past the current mess and remember the glorious nights against Bayern Munich and Atletico Madrid that he helped create.\nHad Gartside got his way, British football could have looked very different.\nHe was a Premier League representative on the Football Association executive board in 2009, when he put forward a proposal for Celtic and Rangers to be allowed to join the English league.\nThe plan was to form a 'Premier League Two' as a buffer for clubs - such as Bolton - who were unable to retain their top-flight status.\nIt was never formally discussed because of opposition from Uefa and many other Premier League clubs.", "summary": "Bolton Wanderers chairman Phil Gartside has died aged 63 following a battle with cancer.", "id": "35543921"}

{"document": "The sign reads \"JOBS\". The backdrop to Mitt Romney's first rally in Ohio today is an artful suggestion of stripped-down, industrial virtue, made in the USA.\nWhen Romney appears, he talks big. Big changes. Big challenges. Big choices. A strategist tells me it is a deliberate contrast with what they say is President Barack Obama's \"small vision for the future\".\nBefore he appears, a prominent Romney surrogate, Senator Rob Portman, urges everyone at the rally to vote as soon as it ends. Now. Today.\nIf those committed enough to come to a rally have already voted, they can spend their time getting other people to the polls or persuading them to vote, he says.\nIn this, if only this, Republicans agree with President Obama, who votes today.\nAs one strategist put it, \"every day is election day.\"\nThere has been a lot of talk of the ground game in this election. In the past that meant sending buses for grannies on polling day - finding out who would like to vote for you and making sure they have transport for the big day.\nFinding out who is sympathetic, apathetic, reluctant or persuadable is still vital. But widespread early voting, as well as postal voting, changes the game.\nOnce a person says in principle they would like to vote for your candidate, you can check that they have gone to vote at all. If they haven't, you can check the next day. And the next. Until they get so fed up they do vote.\nAs an added bonus no last-minute blunder by your candidate allows them to change their mind.\nThis is why it is so important. I've repeatedly said in the end this election will all come down to turnout.\nThink about what Mr Obama did in 2008: he persuaded a lot of people who didn't usually bother to vote, to vote for him. Without those extra votes he would have won, but not have won big.\nSome commentators say that it isn't really that tight a race - Mr Obama is still ahead in the swing states that matter. That's true. But only by a tiny margin, well within a margin of error.\nMr Romney's team are trying to persuade disappointed Obama supporters that their man isn't worth giving another chance, and maybe theirs is.\nA Romney strategist told me they were hoping for \"molt\" - to me a new and novel term for switchers.\nSo Mr Obama needs to get as many of those half-hearted 2008 voters in the bag as possible.

The fall broke her neck, back and ribs and left her paralysed from the chest down.\nClaire first saw the \"robot legs\", or ReWalk bionic walking device, while researching her condition on the internet. She jokingly likens the device to Wallace and Gromit's \"wrong trousers\", and with the help of her friends and family raised the \u00a343,000 necessary to get them.\nBut walking in \"techno trousers\" is not as quite as easy as in the Nick Park animation - while the \"wrong trousers\" walk on their own, Claire's require patience, perseverance and intense effort.\nShe says: \"Not feeling my body makes it so hard. I don't know what my feet are doing.\"\nClaire relies on motion sensors to help her move and lift her legs and one of the most difficult things for her has been simply learning to stand on two feet again.\n\"To start with I just had to find my balance without wobbling.\"\nThe London marathon is not the only race Claire is competing in, as she and her one-year-old daughter, Maisie, are battling it out to see who will be the first to walk unaided.\n\"We've had this competition all along so we'll see. She can do 10 steps on her own now. I'm as wobbly as her.\"\nClaire hopes to raise more than \u00a350,000 for Spinal Research, a charity which funds medical research to develop treatments for paralysis.\nFormer rugby player Matt Hampson, who was paralysed after a rugby accident, will provide moral support for part of her marathon journey, as will retired tennis player Tim Henman and former champion British equestrian Lucinda Green.\n\"There's a lot of people who are worse off than me and haven't got the support I've got, so I want to raise as much as I can.\"\nBut, when the marathon is over, Claire thinks that for the first time in six years, she will be delighted to return to her wheelchair.", "summary": "Six years ago, professional horse-rider Claire Lomas was told that she would never walk again but now she is attempting to walk more than 26 miles (42km) at Sunday's London Marathon thanks to a pair of \"robot legs\", which have transformed her life.", "id": "17743915"}

{"document": "The procedure involves holding down the Falcon 9 on its launch pad and then igniting its Merlin engines.\nThe test only runs for a few seconds, but it tells engineers that all nine engines at the base of the vehicle, and the sub-systems that support them, are functioning normally.\nIf the test throws up no anomalies, the Falcon is given the green light to go ahead with its mission.\nClearly, though, on this occasion, something went catastrophically wrong. The entire rocket and its satellite payload were destroyed in an explosion.\nCompany CEO Elon Musk said the problem - whatever it was - occurred during the operation to fill the rocket with propellant, so the event happened just prior to the test ignition.\nRemarkably, the lightning towers surrounding the pad stayed standing in the face of the blast, and so did the erector tower that is used to feed cables and fluids to the rocket.\nUndoubtedly, though, Launch Complex 40 as it is known, will have suffered significant damage. Twisted and bent metal was visible to long-range cameras.\nBut the repairs to the pad are only a part of SpaceX's immediate problems.\nIts launch schedule will now be put on hold, perhaps for many weeks, as engineers try to understand what happened and to correct any procedural errors and hardware failures.\nThat is going to be a headache for SpaceX's many customers who are waiting patiently for a ride.\nThe Amos-6 satellite that was lost in the explosion is just one spacecraft in a very long line of platforms that have contracts to fly on the Falcon.\nThey have little option but to accept the delay; you cannot very easily swap rockets like you can swap trains.\nMost of the backlog is made up of commercial payloads, and every extra month these expensive satellites stay on the ground will hit their operators' revenues.\nConsider customers like Iridium - one of the main sat-phone providers. It was due to send up the first 10 spacecraft in its new constellation of satellites on a Falcon later this month. Iridium has big loans that need to be serviced.\nAt Nasa, too, they will be frustrated. The agency sends cargo to the space station on Falcons, and the next freight mission was scheduled for November.\nMore concerning however is the shadow this incident casts over the issue of human transportation.\nSpaceX has a contract to use its Falcon to take astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS). Manned test flights were expected in the next 18 months.\nIs that timeline realistic now? This is the second accident involving a Falcon inside 15 months, after a vehicle broke up in flight in June 2015.\nThe Falcon's performance will have reverberations with the US military also.\nSpaceX is working hard to convince the Pentagon that it has a reliable rocket system that can be entrusted with high-value national security missions. That job just got a little harder.\nSetbacks are inevitable in this business, however, and SpaceX has shown before that it can bounce back.\nCustomers and commentators alike have warmed to the company and its charismatic leader, Elon Musk.\nThey have been impressed with the new ideas that SpaceX has tried to introduce - most notably the attempt to make the Falcon cheaper by making it re-usable.\nJust this week we saw the Luxembourg-based satellite operator SES, one of the biggest such companies in the world, announce that it would be the first to use one of these \"second-hand rockets\".\nBut it's difficult to run a routine operation and innovate at the same time.\nIf June 2015 is any guide, SpaceX will likely park some of its future plans while it gets everyone in the company to focus on the fundamentals to get the Falcon flying again as soon as possible.", "summary": "It is usual for SpaceX to do a \"hot fire\" test a few days before a launch.", "id": "37247598"}

It is up to hospitals to negotiate their own rates for extra work, with the most lucrative ones in place for routine treatments, such as knee and hip replacements.\nConsultants doing overtime in these areas commonly make \u00a3600 for a four-hour shift - three to four times what they normally get. Overtime for urgent and emergency work tends to be much lower - around \u00a3300 for a shift.\nOf Scotland's 14 health boards, 12 responded to the freedom of information requests. This showed spending going up from \u00a314.27m in 2013/14 to \u00a320.92m in 2015/16.\nNHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde paid out the most, with an outlay of \u00a37,749,870 on higher rate payments for additional shifts, while NHS Orkney did not make any payments.\nNHS Grampian had the greatest increase in payments, from zero in 2013/14 to \u00a31.6m two years later.\nThere were also sharp increases at NHS Lanarkshire, from \u00a31.8m to \u00a33.4m, and NHS Lothian, from \u00a31.3m to \u00a32.1m.\nA number of hospitals asked about the payments UK-wide said there was a shortage of consultants, meaning they had to try to get existing staff to do extra work.\nThey also said high emergency-room pressures had led to the cancellation of more routine treatments, increasing the need for overtime.\nA spokesman for the British Medical Association said: \"The fact is the NHS is only paying overtime on this scale because it does not have enough doctors to do the work.\"\nHowever, Scotland's health secretary insisted that consultant staffing was at a record high.\nMs Robison said: \"NHS consultant numbers have increased by almost 43% under this government to a record high level. This spend on overtime represents a tiny percentage of the overall spend on consultants.\n\"We are determined to eradicate high cost overtime payments in NHS Scotland, which is why we have launched a national programme for the effective management of all temporary staffing, to help boards move away from reliance on high cost temporary staff, reduce overall costs and ensure value for money for NHS Scotland.\n\"We have also set up and championed the use of local 'staff bank' systems, which are a pool of flexible NHS-employed staff who fill the majority of short term vacant shifts at NHS pay rates. Work is now underway to develop these local banks into integrated regional and national staff banks to allow greater flexibility across NHS Scotland and minimise reliance on agency staff.\n\"In the meantime the use of overtime and locum staff allows NHS Boards to respond to periods of planned and unplanned absence including long term sickness, unexpected vacancies and maternity and paternity leave ensuring service continuity during these times.\"", "summary": "Growing pressures on hospitals are forcing them to ramp up costly overtime payments to consultants to do extra work, a BBC investigation shows.", "id": "36897564"}

{"document": "But when the last Labour government tried to bring them in the plan faced robust opposition, and the reintroduction of ID cards is not currently being considered by this government.\nEveryone, even children, had to carry an ID card during World War Two.  Introduced in 1939 the idea was to enable the government to keep track of a transient population, displaced by bombs or evacuated from their homes.  The wartime ID card system remained in place after 1945, eventually going out of use in the early 1950s.\nLabour revived the idea of a national identity card scheme at the start of the new century.\nDavid Blunkett, the then Home Secretary, outlined the plans in 2002. At the time the project had an estimated  cost of up to \u00a33bn.\nHe said the cards would ensure people did not work if they were not entitled to and did not \"draw on services which are free in this country, unless they are entitled to\".\nIn March 2006 and after several defeats in the House of Lords, the Identity Cards Act became law and in November 2008 the roll-out of compulsory ID cards for foreign nationals began .\nThe scheme remained controversial and in 2009 a new Home Secretary, Alan Johnson said the cards would not be compulsory for UK citizens, however pilot schemes continued and at the end of 2009 people in Greater Manchester became the first in the UK to be able to buy a biometric ID card - at a cost of \u00a330.\nBy the time of the 2010 General Election around 15,000 were thought to be in circulation, but Labour lost the election and the new coalition government scrapped the project.  The cards were no longer valid and the national identity register, which held the personal details of everyone issued with an identity card, including photographs and fingerprint biometrics was destroyed in 2011.\nVarious arguments have been put forward for and against the use of ID cards .\nThose in favour say they provide clarity for employers, are the only way to properly deal with illegal immigration and tackle both identity and benefit fraud.  It has also been suggested they could help in the fight against terrorism.\nThose against ID cards point to the expense of bringing in any scheme, Labour's project is said to have cost \u00a35bn.  Opponents also highlight the civil liberties concerns and what they believe is unnecessary data collection and intrusion by the state.\nIn response to the recent scenes of thousands of migrants trying to get to the UK after crossing from North Africa and travelling through Europe, the deputy mayor of Calais, Philippe Mignonet has said the UK should introduce ID cards (and employment controls).\nBut there's still strong opposition to the idea here.\nThe anti-ID cards pressure group NO2ID remains in existence and is withering about the deputy mayor's suggestion.  NO2ID's General Secretary Guy Herbert disagrees with the deputy mayor: \"France has had ID cards for decades, but they have not stopped migrants coming to his town.\n\"In fact though coalition rhetoric was against the Blair government's centralised scheme, the UK makes lots of demands on people to produce ID in various forms in everyday life. This is getting steadily worse, but does not seem to have made much difference to people with strong motivations to come here.\"\nAnd the deputy mayor of Calais is likely to be disappointed by the response from Britain's politicians too.\nThe Shadow Immigration Minister David Hanson was in the Home Office when Labour introduced its scheme. When asked what he thought now about identity cards, he said: \" I felt they were a way in which we can at least track and identify individuals but that debate has moved on... we're not going to introduce them in the near future given the capital and financial cost of doing that - what we need to do is to ensure that we have proper enforcement.\"\nThe Home Office also rejected the idea, a spokesperson said: \"The government has no plans to introduce ID cards in the UK.\"\nRead more: Would Calais migrants really be better off in the UK?", "summary": "The deputy mayor of Calais, Philippe Mignonet wants the UK to introduce identity cards as part of efforts to deter migrants gathering at the French port and attempting to cross the channel.", "id": "33756783"}

Cue wild celebration.\nIf you add together Mr Netanyahu's natural allies among the religious parties and the rest of the right - and assume he'll be able to attract at least one party from the centre or even the left - then he should be able to form a government again.\nSenior Likud figure Danny Danon was quick to tell me that the only thing that would be remembered from this night was the fact that his boss had won a third term as prime minister.\n\"There is only one prime minister possible for Israel from these results.

The party may well emerge as the second largest grouping in the new Knesset and should command a place in a Netanyahu-led coalition.\nBecause Mr Lapid is a political newcomer, it's hard to say what price he might try to extract in return for his support.\nBut you can expect a higher profile for the vexed issue of whether Israel's ultra-Orthodox community ought to be required to perform its share of national service (it's currently exempt).\nThe wider world will examine these results for clues about Israel's future attitude towards peace talks with the Palestinians or the possibility of a pre-emptive strike on Iran's nuclear facilities.\nThe truth of the matter is that it's far too early to make those kind of judgements, which will depend on the balance of forces within a future coalition more than on the outcome of the popular vote.\nBut the sudden and decisive lurch to the right that many predicted hasn't happened.\nThe results show that there's plenty of life on the left and the centre of Israeli politics too.\nSome political journalists at Likud headquarters were arguing within hours of the exit polls that the results sent such a confused signal about the political mood in Israel that they made another election likely within a year.\nWe'll see.\nHaving said this is a chastening result for Benjamin Netanyahu it's only fair to record that it's been a thought provoking one for anyone in the business of making political predictions here, too.\nMr Netanyahu was supposed to win easily - and he certainly didn't.\nAnd the campaign was supposed to have failed to capture the Israeli imagination - and turnout was remarkably high.\nIt's said to take an average of well over a month to form a coalition government after polling day here - and there's no reason to assume that it will be any quicker than the average this time around.\nThe first contacts between party leaders were probably under way before the celebrations at Likud HQ had died away.\nIsrael and the wider Middle East must now wait to see what sort of government will eventually emerge.", "summary": "When the giant TV screens at the Likud election headquarters finally flashed up the results of the national exit polls, one-by-one there was a sudden tidal wave of sound.", "id": "21155064"}

He was given a 30-year minimum term.\nThe case sparked a wider investigation into the work of the unit between July 2008 and September 2009, the results of which have now been published.\nThe IPCC has carried out five previous inquiries into Southwark Sapphire command and it is the police watchdog's ninth investigation into the Met's response to victims of sexual violence.\nBy Danny ShawHome affairs correspondent, BBC News\nNo one will ever know if Jean Say's children would be alive today if he'd been arrested and investigated for rape three years before he stabbed them to death.\nBut if police hadn't \"no-crimed\" the rape allegation, the chances are Say's threatening and violent behaviour would have been uncovered.\nThe Say case is the most egregious example of the dysfunctional approach to rape investigations at the Southwark Sapphire unit; what we don't know is how many other sexual assault victims were wrongly disbelieved and the impact that's had on them and on others.\nAlthough Scotland Yard says the Sapphire units have changed for the better, the practice of no-crimeing is still a problem across other forces: in England and Wales reported rapes are three times as likely to be written off as other incidents are.\nHome affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said three Metropolitan officers who had been facing possible dismissal over a previous bungled investigation into the serial sex offender Kirk Reid, were still with the force.\nTwo of them, a superintendent and a detective inspector, have been promoted.\nA detective sergeant is facing disciplinary proceedings for alleged gross misconduct in connection with the allegations.\nIn another case, Det Con Ryan Coleman-Farrow, who was based in Southwark, was jailed for 16 months in October last year for failing to investigate rape and sexual assault claims.\nA second officer, based in Islington, north London, is still under criminal investigation.\nIn total 19 officers from across London have been disciplined, including three who have been sacked.\nA Met Police spokesman said: \"We have for some time acknowledged that previous investigation of rape and serious sexual assault in the MPS was below standard.\n\"The activities identified in this report came during that era and highlight specific issues within Southwark which resulted in unacceptable actions by local officers.\n\"It is as a result of such failings that we have made substantial changes to the investigation of rape and serious sexual assault, both in terms of structure and revised working practices.\"", "summary": "A police officer at a sex crime unit encouraged a woman to drop a rape claim against a man who went on to murder his two children, a report has said.", "id": "21586786"}

{"document": "Speaking about the 1948 contract Nye Bevan, the founding father of the NHS, offered consultants, he said he had \"stuffed their mouths with gold\".\nThat gold was the ability to continue private practice - something senior doctors have carefully guarded since.\nDown the years, several ministers have had a look at the issue, but concluded it was simply too tricky to tackle.\nOne former health secretary told me they thought consultants would simply walk away en masse if the government got tough.\nThere has been some movement. In fact, the current contract had a little nibble at restricting private practice, by insisting that any doctor doing fewer than 11 shifts (of four hours each) a week offers any extra work to the NHS first before accepting private work.\nIt has probably had some impact, but only a little. A full-time contract is 10 shifts, so it ties them to only an extra four hours a week before they are free to work in the private sector.\nBut after years of shying away from the issue, the government looks like it wants to tackle this head on. It is not being explicit in coming out and saying it wants curbs on private practice.\nBut the implications of the move by NHS England to publish earnings is clear: there is a suspicion that some doctors are raking it in and that affects their motivation when it comes to the NHS - both in terms of working extra hours for the health service and how productive they really want to be - and by publishing the details there is a hope it will make doctors think twice about how much they do.\nLonger NHS waiting lists means more private work as either people will pay to go private or, and this is more common, the NHS has to pay for patients to be seen privately.\nThe private market is worth \u00a34.6bn a year, according to market analysts Laing Buisson, with a quarter coming via NHS referrals.\nAt a time when money is tight and ministers want to get more seven-day services, tackling this is clearly an attractive proposition.\nAlthough with the consultant contract currently in the process of being renegotiated (talks have slowed because of the junior doctor dispute), expect consultants to be hopping mad that their pay is once again in the headlines.\nIt promises to be the mother of all battles.\nBut if the register of private work is published, what will it show? What is known about the extent of private work is pretty sketchy.\nA British Medical Association survey from 2009 suggested about half of doctors in the UK (it's not limited to England) did private work - but this was a fall from six in 10 when it was done several years before that.\nOf those that did private work, a quarter earn under \u00a310,000 a year, while one in six made in excess of \u00a3100,000.\nThis included private hospital work, alongside earnings from other sources such as providing advice to pharmaceutical companies and assessments for insurance companies.\nBut it must be said this was a self-selecting poll - doctors were not compelled to take part, so it is hard to gauge whether it was truly representative.\nThere are plenty of specialities where private work is not so easy to come by.\nBut there are others - orthopaedic surgery, urology, ophthalmology and anaesthetics to name just four - where there is plenty of work. It means for some, earnings can be extremely high.\nAverage basic salary for NHS work is \u00a389,000 in England. But this ignores a number of ways doctors can make much more.\nThere are bonuses - called clinical excellence awards - which can be worth tens of thousands of pounds a year. Once awarded, they are difficult to take away.\nAnd then there is overtime work. For some, this can be pretty lucrative - a BBC investigation earlier this year found one made \u00a3375,000 in a year.\nNow that figure is very revealing. That consultant was thought to be on a special deal as they worked in an area where there is a shortage of consultants.\nIt meant the NHS was prepared to pay them close to what they could have got on the private market. All in all, it suggests there are consultants out there earning in excess of \u00a3500,000.\nRead more from Nick\nFollow Nick on Twitter", "summary": "The fight over NHS consultants' private work - and that is exactly what this is - goes back to the very start of the NHS.", "id": "37379464"}

{"document": "If that happens, the ice loss could push up global oceans by 2m, or more.\nThe claim is based on an assessment of the rocks underlying the ice stream.\nScientists tell the journal Nature that should the front of the glacier retreat about 150km from its current position, it will then enter a runaway reversal that takes it 200-250km further inland.\nMost of the big glaciers in the east of the White Continent appear relatively quiescent; Totten is something of an exception.\nIt is experiencing a thinning rate of about half a metre per year, according to the latest satellite measurements.\nPrevious research indicates this is probably being driven by warm ocean water getting under and melting the floating front of the glacier.\nWhat Alan Aitken and colleagues have now done is examine a possible future for Totten if the shrinkage continues.\nThey have used gravity and magnetic data recorded over the entire catchment feeding the glacier to understand its past behaviour.\nThey find that the underlying sedimentary rocks at the modern front of Totten are heavily eroded, as are the rocks in fjords deep in the interior of the catchment. The inference is that these sections are where persistent, moving ice has had time to grind down the geology.\nIt is the mid-region, however, that piques the team's interest. Here, the sediments are relatively thick, suggesting that ice fronts have historically been resident in this section for only short periods.\nThis mid-region is also where the rock bed dips inland - a geometry that glaciologists say is naturally unstable and accelerates any glacier retreat.\n\"What this all tells us is that once the ice margin starts to go back, it goes back quite rapidly to a newer, stable position way inland. And if you do that our modelling indicates you will lose ice equivalent to 1.5-2m of sea level rise,\" co-author Prof Martin Siegert from Imperial College London, UK, told BBC News.\nThe last time Totten retreated to the deep interior of the France-sized catchment was probably in the Pliocene Epoch, he added.\n\"Three-point-five million years ago, atmospheric carbon dioxide levels were in the region of 400 parts per million - so about where they are now. The atmosphere was a couple of degrees warmer than it is now, which is in line with what we expect for the end of this century if we do nothing about it. The Pliocene is where we're headed.\"\nEven so, the timescale for the far retreat inland would be on the order of centuries, on current trends.\nThe international community has of course committed itself to doing something about climate change, promising at the Paris talks in December to try to keep the global atmospheric temperature rise above pre-industrial levels to \"well below 2C\".\nVarious analyses, however, suggest a 2.7C increase is a more likely outcome, based on the voluntary national curbs to greenhouse gas emissions promised at the meeting.\nAnd that variance could be significant, according to research presented at the recent European Geosciences Union meeting in Vienna last month.\nProf Rob DeConto from the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, US, has modelled possible ice losses from the Antarctic continent based on the two temperature figures.\nFor a 2C rise, he found minimal change by the end of this century. On the other hand, for 2.7C he identified ice losses equivalent to many tens of centimetres of sea-level rise.\n\"There's threshold behaviour in the Antarctic ice sheet system,\" Prof DeConto told reporters at EGU.\n\"We don't know exactly where that line is, but according to these results somewhere between 2C and 2.7C makes a very big difference.\"\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos", "summary": "Unchecked climate change could put Antarctica's huge Totten Glacier into an unstable configuration over the coming centuries, a study has warned.", "id": "36327250"}

The body, shrouded in a white sheet and placed in a weighted bag, was then positioned on a flat board, tipped up, and eased into the Arabian Sea.\nThis occurred at 0600GMT, approximately 12 hours after the firefight during which Osama Bin Laden was shot in the head.\nAfter this first shot, reports ABC News' The Blotter, he was shot again, to make sure that he was dead.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00acThe body was then flown to Afghanistan and Bin Laden's identity was confirmed.

First, that they did not want his grave to become a shrine. Second, that there was no time to negotiate with other countries to arrange a possible burial on land.\nAccording to CBS News, Saudi Arabia refused to take the body. If correct, this suggests that an offer was made - and that had Saudi Arabia accepted the body, there would have been a grave, which could in theory have become a shrine.\nHowever, ABC's Jonathan Karl, writing before the burial was confirmed, painted a different picture:\n\"US officials tell me the last thing they want is for his burial place to become a terrorist shrine.\n\"To avoid that, an informed source tells me, the intention is to bury his body at sea - leaving no definitive location for the final resting place of his body.\"", "summary": "US officials say Osama Bin Laden's body was treated with respect and buried at sea, but some Muslims argue there was no good reason for not burying it on land.", "id": "13261680"}

That will cause growth in consumer spending to slow from an expected 2.5% this year to 0.5% in 2017 and 0.9% the year after, the report said.\nBusiness investment is also forecast to fall due to uncertainty surrounding Britain's future trading relationship with the EU, dropping 1.5% this year and more than 2% in 2017.\nEY predicts that the impact of weaker consumer spending and falling investment will cause UK GDP growth to drop sharply to 0.8% next year, before expanding to 1.4% in 2018.\nPeter Spencer, chief economic advisor to the EY Item Club, said: \"So far it might look like the economy is taking Brexit in its stride, but this picture is deceptive.\n\"Sterling's shaky performance this month provides a timely reminder that challenges lie ahead. As inflation returns over the winter it will squeeze household incomes and spending.\n\"The pressure on consumers and the cautious approach to spending by businesses mean that the UK is facing a period of relatively low growth,\" he said.\nThe report said that exporters will benefit from the depreciation of sterling, which last week tumbled against a basket of currencies. Exports will increase by 4.5% in 2017 and 5.6% in 2018, EY forecast.\nBut Mr Spencer did not expect this to be enough to offset a wider slowdown.\n\"With activity in the domestic market flat, GDP growth will become heavily dependent upon exports next year,\" he said.\n\"But once the UK has left the EU certain sectors, such as aerospace, automotive, and chemicals that trade extensively with the EU will be a lot more vulnerable and may need to be supported by subsidies and more robust industrial policies,\" he said.\nSome of the economic challenges were spelled out in Mr Broadbent's BBC interview with 5 live's Sean Farrington.\nThe deputy governor, echoing remark's by the Bank's governor Mark Carney last week, said that letting inflation run ahead of the 2% target might ensure the economy does not suffer.\nTighter monetary policy to meet the target could lead to \"undesirable consequences\" such as lower growth and higher unemployment, he said.

{"document": "My confusion stems from the proposals for tax, benefit and economic reform submitted by the Greek government to secure, at the very last minute of the last hour, a deal from their creditors to avoid tumbling out of the euro.\nHaving obtained a copy of this paper, headed \"Greece: Prior Actions - Policy Commitments and Actions to be taken in consultation with the EC/ECB/IMF staff\", it feels very familiar.\nThat familiarity stems from its great similarity to the bailout proposals put to Greece by the creditors - the eurozone governments, the European Central Bank and the IMF - last month.\nPretty much everything wanted by the creditors is there - with the odd tweak or softening, but nothing which looks as though it ought to be noxious to them.\nSo there is a pledge for budget surpluses rising in steps to 3.5% of GDP or national income by 2018; VAT would be raised to three rates of 23% (the standard rate), 13% (for food, energy, hotels and water) and 6% (for medicine and books) - increases that would raise revenue equivalent to 1% of GDP; and Athens is eating the dust of comprehensive reforms of pensions to make them more affordable; and so on.\nSo here's why I am a bit baffled.\nOnly a few days ago the Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras won an overwhelming mandate from the Greek people, in a referendum, to reject more-or-less these bailout terms.\nAnd today, on the back of that popular vote, he is signing up to the supposedly hated bailout.\nThis is big politics that would make Lewis Carroll proud.\nDoes that mean the eurozone can go back to life as normal, of inadequate economic performance but Greek Armageddon deferred (again)? Is a rescue done and dusted?\nNot yet.\nTsipras has to get these proposals through the Greek parliament today - though his pax of earlier this week with the main opposition parties will surely deliver that (at the price of the splintering away of some of his own supporters).\nThen there is the small question of whether eurozone ministers will stump up the 35bn euros requested by Greece from the European Stability Mechanism to meet debt repayments through to June 30 2018.\nAnd Athens wants a nod that there'll be proper negotiations on reducing its completely unaffordable debt burden by around 30%, as per the IMF's recent sustainability analysis (which would be achieved through the backdoor route of rescheduling repayments closer to the end of time, rather than through the direct write-offs that so offend Germans and east Europeans).\nFinally, and most problematically, something has to be done to take the banks out of intensive care. Given the recent melting down of the Greek economy, my sources tell me there is now a solvency problem for Greek banks, to add to the awkwardness for them that they are almost out of cash.\nHere is the point. If a way isn't found to allow the banks to re-open within days - and the ECB simply maintaining Emergency Liquidity Assistance won't come anywhere near to achieving that, but the ECB has lost all appetite for throwing more good money after bad - the Greek economy will implode so that any bailout deal agreed this weekend will become irrelevant in weeks.\nBecause the Greek economy would be so melting down that tax revenues would collapse and Athens would need yet more eurozone handouts.

She says she has seen the iridescent clouds only once with her own eyes - and she knows precisely when and what to look for.\nSuch phenomena could have taken Munch completely by surprise, she believes.\nThe team first started investigating the possible link between the unusual meteorology and The Scream when consultant Svein Fikke observed a display of the clouds in 2014.\nHe managed to take a series of stunning photos, and then started delving deeper into the story.\nSome very rare cloud types are reported to be increasing in frequency and distribution, perhaps due to climate change.\nAn example would be Noctilucent Clouds. These are the highest clouds on Earth, forming at altitudes of 80km and more. There is evidence to suggest they are becoming more visible at lower latitudes than used to be the case.\nIt is conceivable similar trends might occur with Nacreous Clouds, Dr Muri said, although no statistics can justify such a statement yet.\n\"We know that the troposphere is warming and expanding while the stratosphere above is compressing and cooling.

{"document": "But many people will be asking this weekend if the 28-year-old is really worth all that money?\nTo answer that you need to separate his value to United right now from how some might view his broader value in the transfer market.\nFor all the income they generate, United are a club going through a difficult transition. They are way off the pace in the Premier League and struggling to qualify for the Champions League next season.\nThe financial impact of failure this season will not dent the money making machine that is Old Trafford, but long term decline? That's a very different proposition.\nAll of this has placed huge pressure on the club's new manager David Moyes and executive vice chairman Ed Woodward to show the club is still a force to be reckoned with despite the retirement of the formidable Sir Alex Ferguson.\nThe record signing of Juan Mata from Chelsea in the January transfer window was the first part of what Woodward and Moyes hope will be a three-step strategy back to the top.\nRooney's new deal is part two while the summer is phase three. That's when we will really be able to judge how serious the club's American owners, the Glazer family, are about rebuilding United's under-powered squad.\nMata's arrival and Rooney's decision to stay - having been courted first by Manchester City and more recently Chelsea - will surely help the club attract top talent before the start of next season.\nThe other thing to consider is that Rooney had just 18 months remaining on his previous deal. United knew they faced the possibility of him leaving for nothing. By signing him up for five and-a-half years, they have protected the value of arguably their most valuable and recognisable playing asset.\nSo while the \u00a385m agreement up to 2019 looks exorbitant, it's probably cheaper than United having to find a replacement in the transfer market and pay his wages. The total cost would have probably been much higher.\nIt leaves United free to spend their money elsewhere - with midfield and defence arguably a greater priority.\nThe deal Rooney has signed is, I am told, worth around \u00a3250,000 a week in basic salary. What makes the new contract potentially much more lucrative to the England striker is an agreement with the club to market and exploit his individual commercial rights around the world.\nThis obviously has benefits for both the club and the player but there is no doubting United's hugely successful commercial operation could help take Rooney to a new financial level and certainly on a par with Barcelona's Lionel Messi and Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo.\nIn playing terms it would be hard to argue Rooney is in the same league as those two.\nBut as things stand he is United's most marketable brand and that is ultimately why the club couldn't afford to let him go.", "summary": "With projected revenues of \u00a3420m this year, there is no question Manchester United can afford to make Wayne Rooney the best paid player in the Premier League.", "id": "26294274"}

They should play more,\" Mr Xi said.\nThe school day in China's state schools starts at 7am with various physical exercises.\nAmongst other daily constitutionals, such as Tai Chi, pupils are encouraged to massage their eyes to keep them healthy and get them ready for the day.\nThe children have two meal breaks in the 12-hour school day and will exercise together every day - sometimes twice a day.\nThe teaching style is focused on note-taking and repetition, otherwise known as rote learning.\nThis is a great contrast to England's more interactive teaching style, where pupils are encouraged to participate in class and make judgments for themselves.\nThe Chinese believe children learn faster and better by rote learning\nChinese children live under the One Child Policy and feel the weight of responsibility on their shoulders, so there is great importance placed on their educational achievements.\nGood exam results are associated with social status and success and entire families can pin all their hopes on the single child.\nChinese pupils learn the same subjects as English school children in the main, but are combined with practical work experience around the school campus, as well as Chinese culture, morality and ethics.\nOne feature of Chinese schools that England's teachers may welcome is that the pupils almost always are required to clean their own classrooms.\nChina's schools educate an estimated 192,000,000 children - a fifth of the world's school age children.\nIn a speech in Shanghai on Friday, Sir Anthony, now vice-chancellor of the University of Buckingham, said: \"China has some of the top schools in the world and is leading the way with maths and science.\"\nIndeed Shanghai and Hong Kong are among the top performing districts in the world, according to the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development.\nSir Anthony added: \"It is the 'human' skills that cannot be replaced by computers that Chinese schools and schools worldwide need to be giving far greater focus.\n\"Many schools are robbing the young of the opportunity to blossom into the unique individuals that they are because too many teachers think that solely cramming pupils' heads full of facts is education.\n\"Many education systems focus on exams being the sole validators of school, but recent research suggests that jobs with a big growth in salary have been those that require a high degree of social skills,\" he adds.\nSir Anthony, former master of leading private school Wellington College, is a great advocate of protecting and enhancing pupils' well-being in order to maximise their potential to learn and express themselves confidently.\nLike many private schools, Wellington College has an international school in China, where it offers a traditional English public school education.", "summary": "China's education system is robbing its young people of the chance to become unique individuals, a leading educationalist says.", "id": "34605430"}

{"document": "It may be their signature pose, but how and why the birds perch on one limb has been a longstanding puzzle.\nNow, a team from the US has shown that flamingos employ no active muscular effort when they're unipedal, meaning they are also expending less energy.\nA passive mechanism is engaged in the one-legged position, allowing flamingos to stand proud while having a doze.\nPreviously, researchers had wondered whether the one-legged position might help reduce muscle fatigue, as the birds alternated from standing on one leg to the other.\nOther teams have proposed that this behaviour helps regulate body temperature.\nNow, Prof Young-Hui Chang, from the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech) in Atlanta, and Lena H Ting, of Atlanta's Emory University, have uncovered the mechanical secrets behind this impressive trick.\nThe researchers conducted several experiments with both live and dead birds. Amazingly, they found that flamingo cadavers could be made to stand one-legged without any external support.\nIn a paper published in the Royal Society journal Biology Letters, they describe this phenomenon as a \"passive gravitational stay mechanism\".\n\"If you look at the bird from the front, while they're standing on one leg, the foot is directly beneath the body which means that their leg is angled inward. That's the pose you have to strike in order to engage the stay mechanism,\" Prof Chang told BBC News.\nHowever, dead birds cannot stand unsupported on two legs, suggesting a greater role for active muscle force in this posture:  \"If you tilt it to the vertical, like you would if you were standing on two legs, the whole thing disengages,\" said the director of the Comparative Neuromechanics Laboratory at Georgia Tech.\nThe researchers also studied live birds, and showed that when they were standing one-legged and resting, they hardly moved at all - underlining the stability of this passive position. However, the birds did sway somewhat when the one-legged posture was combined with an activity, such as grooming or calling out.\nProf Chang said the underlying anatomical apparatus that enables the passive posture was not yet understood - this is the next step in the team's research. But he explained that the phenomenon did not involve the limb joints locking.\n\"A lock would imply that it's fixed in both directions. What we found is that it's fixed in one direction, but flexible in the other direction, so we call it a 'stay' rather than a 'lock'. It's more akin to a doorstop,\" he told me.\nDr Matthew Anderson, an experimental psychologist who specialises in animal behaviour at St Joseph's University in Philadelphia, described the team's results as a \"significant step forward\".\nThe researcher, who was not involved with the latest study, added: \"They begin to answer the question of how flamingos are able to rest on one leg. Importantly, these authors do not examine when and where flamingos actually utilise the behaviour in question, and thus this paper does not really address the issue of why flamingos rest while on one leg.\"\nDr Anderson's own research suggests that the birds adopt the unusual posture in order to conserve heat. Among other things, his team found that the number of birds resting on one leg falls as temperatures rise.\n\"Providing evidence of the mechanism that supports/allows for the behaviour to occur does not necessarily provide insight into why it happens in the first place.\"\nFollow Paul on Twitter.", "summary": "Flamingos expend less energy standing on one leg than in a two-legged stance, scientists have confirmed.", "id": "40016816"}

{"document": "Motorcycles used as taxis and known as boda bodas are time-savers for people who need to get somewhere in Tanzania's north-western city of Mwanza.\nThey seem to be the only way to beat traffic jams. But when you get on the bike and wrap your arms around the driver, you are actually putting your life in his hands.\nIn the first half of this year, there were more than 5,000 road accidents in Tanzania. More than a quarter of them were motorcycle accidents.\nBoda boda drivers are often blamed for causing the problems on Mwanza's roads. They might get you where you want to go quickly, but they have a reputation for driving recklessly.\nThere are hundreds of them competing for fares, which increases the risk of accidents.\nBut that is also where trainee doctor Marko Hingi saw an opportunity to turn boda boda drivers into true life-savers.\nHe was inspired by the fact that wherever there is a medical emergency in Mwanza, there is likely to be a motorcycle taxi driver nearby.\n\"We have human beings here and we can use them as volunteers to help,\" says Mr Hingi, who works at a hospital in the city.\nHe is also head of the Tanzania Rural Health Movement, which recruits boda boda drivers and turns them into first-responders, acting like paramedics.\n\"In the past when somebody got injured, he bled while people looked at him until he died,\" says Anicet Mase, one of Mr Hingi's volunteer drivers.\nNow Mr Mase zips around Mwanza wearing a fluorescent orange vest and a backpack full of bandages and other first-aid kit.\nHe and the other volunteer drivers have been trained in basic first-aid, such as keeping airways open, stopping bleeding and splinting fractured bones.\nThe drivers also have mobile phones and are linked to a system called Beacon.\nMwanza's fire station receives calls reporting emergencies.\nA dispatcher enters the details into the Beacon software, which then sends a text message to everyone linked to the system.\nIf a motorcycle taxi driver is nearby, he can respond to the emergency.\n\"We've designed [the Beacon] to be used in countries that don't have the resources to implement a robust EMS [Emergency Medical Services] system,\" says Michael McGee, the East Africa representative of Trek Medics International, which developed Beacon and runs a similar programme in the Dominican Republic.\nThis \"robust\" service involves people calling for ambulances on emergency numbers such as 999, 112 or 911.\nBut this is expensive and does not exist in many poorer countries. It is up to the sick and injured to get to hospital any way they can.\nWhen Mr Hingi was six he remembers his sick mother walking to hospital, worrying that wild dogs would attack her on the way.\nThat childhood memory inspired Mr Hingi's dream to become a doctor and bring ambulances to Mwanza.\n\"Communities are suffering because they lack a good system to help them,\" he says.\nAs for Mr Mase, he is driven by the idea that boda boda drivers are now given the opportunity to counter their bad reputation for putting lives at risk on the roads.\nA big part of his work is to deal with injuries caused on the roads.\nAbout 90% of the 1.25 million people killed every year in traffic accidents die in low and middle income countries.\nHowever, there is a limit to what motorbike drivers can do to help.\nSome of Tanzania's roads are in too bad a condition for them to reach patients and evacuate them safely.\nSo, even though the motorcycles in Mwanza find it easier to avoid potholes and wind through traffic, there is work to be done before boda boda drivers can really claim to be saving lives rather than putting them at risk.", "summary": "Tanzania's motorcycle taxi drivers, often associated with deadly road accidents, are being trained to become life-savers, writes Ross Velton.", "id": "38018716"}

{"document": "All examples of this group, known as the Archosauromorpha, lay eggs.\nThis led some scientists to wonder whether there was something in their biology that prevented live births.\nBut examination of the fossil remains of a very long-necked, 245 million-year-old marine reptile from China revealed it was carrying an embryo.\nJun Liu, first author of the new study in Nature Communications, told BBC News that the animal would have measured between three and four metres long, with a neck that was about 1.7m long.\nThe embryo may have been around half a metre long and is positioned inside the rib cage of the adult Dinocephalosaurus fossil, which was discovered in 2008 in Luoping County, Yunnan Province in southern China.\nResearchers had to consider whether the smaller animal might have been part of the adult's last meal. But it's facing forward, whereas swallowed prey generally face backwards because predators consume the animal head first to help it go down the throat.\nAnother line of evidence in favour of the live birth idea is that the small reptile inside the mother is clearly an example of the same species.\nCo-author Prof Mike Benton, from the University of Bristol, told BBC News that the fossil was important because the Archosauromorpha form one of three large groupings of land-based vertebrates (backboned animals), each including about 10,000 species.\nSince we now know that no fundamental biological barrier to live births exists in this group, palaeontologists would be \"looking very closely\" at other fossils.

But living Archosauromorphs all lay eggs very early in embryonic development, whereas this embryo is very advanced, with well developed bones.\nFurthermore, the team says Dinocephalosaurus's long neck and other features of its anatomy suggest it could not have manoeuvred easily out of the water, meaning a reproductive strategy like that of turtles - which lay eggs on land before returning to the water - was probably not an option.\nFollow Paul on Twitter.", "summary": "Scientists have uncovered the first evidence of live births in the group of animals that includes dinosaurs, crocodiles and birds.", "id": "38971504"}

Prof Ramakrishnan said uncertainty over their status was \"really detrimental\".\n\"People can't be expected to work under those circumstances. Many of them may be considering other options and many of them may not come to the UK for that reason,\" he told BBC News.\n\"What would we do if over the next year or two if they all left?  Because these are real people with families and careers to think about, and they will be much sought after by other countries - instability could lead to a short term brain drain with us losing 16% of a highly skilled work force. These people need real reassurance about their future.\"\nProf Ramakrishnan says the government has to reassure all EU citizens, including the 30,000 academics and scientists, that their status is safe and that they will be able to continue to work regardless of what happens with the negotiations. He also called on ministers to make that commitment now.\n\"That single step alone will go a long way to reassuring the community and it will also go a long way in maintaining our image as a welcoming and open society,\" he said.\n\"This should not wait until there is a new Prime Minister. If we are not an attractive destination where people feel they will be welcome, the best will simply go somewhere else and our science will decline.\"\nEarlier, Prof Ramakrishnan's predecessor as president of the Royal Society, Prof Sir Paul Nurse said that freedom of movement has to continue in any post-Brexit negotiations for British science to thrive. It is not just that freedom of movement makes it easier to attract scientists from EU nations, he says; it is a requirement for full membership of the main European research funding body.\nUK universities currently receive 10% of their research funds from EU sources - amounting to around \u00c2\u00a31bn each year. Full participation also allows UK researchers to form valuable research collaborations and to have a say in choosing areas of research.\nIn response, the Science Minister said the UK needed to be able to keep bringing the best people to the UK - but he could not commit to any policy until at least September when a new Prime Minister is chosen by Conservative party members.\n\"We have got to look at what relationship we can establish with respect to future (funding) programmes the EU operates in the process of negotiations that will be undertaken once new leadership is in place. That is not something I can commit to today,\" Mr Johnson told BBC News.\n\"This is going to be a complex piece of work and I can't commit to a particular definition of freedom of movement for you. But it is obviously going to be important that the UK stays open to the brightest and best from the EU and from around the world.\"\nLeave campaigners have argued that many countries which are neither EU members nor have freedom of movement, receive European funding.

{"document": "Less County Championship cricket, a change of numbers in the two-division structure, a more attractive school summer holidays time slot for the T20 Blast and a Lord's one-day knockout final in July are the key outcomes.\nThe aim is to ensure that cricket retains its popularity beyond the time when the current ageing generation which watches Championship cricket has gone - by making it more attractive to the supporters of the future.\nBBC Sport's county cricket expert Kevin Howells\n\"As someone who earns a lot of his living watching Championship cricket, it's expected that I would fight tooth and nail for it to remain totally unchanged. I can't do that, no matter how much good people feel angry about the reduction in games.\n\"The reason is simple. There is too much cricket being played and, despite the best efforts to develop a more user friendly 'appointment to view' schedule, we have still been left with too many competitions all mixed up. It has felt a mess.\n\"The new schedule is clear and strong. Of course, for every positive, one can argue a negative. I could list things I personally would change, such as unequal games between teams in Division Two. But that misses the point of what's trying to be achieved. Over the season, the best teams will be crowned champions of their respective leagues.\n\"One small reservation would be to what extent the Championship might have a stop-start feel to it? There will be a decent start in April and then generally two major blocks mid-season and most importantly at the end of the summer. Until we are in that season, I reserve judgment.\n\"My suspicion is that the T20 schedule is county cricket's last chance to prove it can work before a city franchise is given a green light. The authorities have done what they can and are to play it when families have free time in the summer holidays but the weather remains the biggest player in its future.\n\"Finally, the One-Day Cup should receive much-needed profile. I'm really looking forward to a Lord's final in July, where it belongs.\"\nECB director of cricket Andrew Strauss, a member of the eight-strong group that devised the changes, said: \"Last year a county player could change between formats as many as 24 times over the summer.

{"document": "The cloning of the first animal from an adult cell was a remarkable scientific achievement. It promised new treatments for debilitating diseases. But it also raised fears of cloned human beings, designer babies and a dystopian future.\nTwenty years on, neither the hopes nor the fears have been realised. So what is Dolly's legacy?\nI first saw Dolly in 1997 at the Roslin Institute just outside Edinburgh. She stood apart from the other sheep in the pens at this agricultural research centre. She stood prouder, her fleece seemed like a lion's mane and there was an aura about her.\nDolly's creation had echoes of Mary Shelley's classic novel Frankenstein, in which inanimate tissue was brought to life by electricity.\nDolly was created from DNA taken from a cell taken from an sheep. The technique involved putting the DNA into an empty eggshell and then zapping it with electricity. This created an embryo.\nResearchers at Roslin then implanted the embryo into the womb of a sheep which grew into Dolly - an exact genetic copy of the sheep from which the skin cell was taken.\nIt took 277 attempts to clone Dolly and there were many miscarriages on the way.\nThere were also genuine concerns that it would not be long before cloned humans would be walking the Earth - people would try to clone themselves to achieve a kind of immortality or they might try to resurrect a beloved dead relative.\nThe airwaves were filled with conversations about what it meant to be human, whether the clones would be exactly the same as the person from which they were cloned and what kind of world the scientists were tumbling us into.\nWhen I met the researchers at Roslin they were acutely aware of public suspicion. And they knew it was important to be clear, open and honest about their work. Dolly's creator, Prof Sir Ian Wilmut, could not be any more different from fictional scientists such as Dr Frankenstein or indeed Dr Moreau, who developed human-like hybrids in a story by HG Wells.\nBy contrast, Prof Wilmut is a quietly-spoken man whose motivation was to improve animal welfare and human health. This bespectacled scientist with his gentle candour was ideally complemented by the enthusiastic and eloquent Dr Simon Best, who was brought in to commercialise the technology to improve human health.\nA former manager of the early 1980s pop group The Human League turned biotechnology pioneer, Prof Best knew how to sell a good story and do so with panache.\nBetween them they quickly changed the narrative from that of a nightmare future to one in which cloning was used to treat many incurable diseases. Prof Wilmut and Dr Best promoted the term \"therapeutic cloning\".\nTheir vision was to develop treatments for heart disease, Parkinson's Disease and rheumatism by taking cells from patients and using cloning technology to create healthy tissues which could then be transplanted to heal their damaged cells.\nThis raised further concerns from some church and anti-abortion groups, who were concerned that the process involved the creation, and then destruction, of human embryos. They wanted the technology banned but, following strong lobbying by the medical research community, parliament permitted therapeutic cloning but banned the cloning of human beings.\nSince then, the much hoped-for benefits from therapeutic cloning have not emerged. Some groups in the UK are cloning tissues from patients to study diseases and test drugs. But no so-called cell-replacement treatments have yet been developed.\nHowever, important scientific breakthroughs can - and usually do - take time to have an impact.\nDolly's legacy is to show scientists that animal cells can be reprogrammed. They can be rejuvenated and redirected to form any cell in the human body. Scientists may not have reaped the clinical benefits just yet but, at a stroke, Dolly's birth changed scientific thinking forever.\nIt is hard to imagine how this incredible biological insight won't alter the world fundamentally and in ways we have yet to imagine.", "summary": "The birth of Dolly the sheep seemed one of those moments in scientific research that would change the world forever.", "id": "36707743"}

Now when a parent sends their child to school they have no idea who is teaching them.\n\"If any suggestion was made that unqualified doctors were let loose on patients there would be public outrage.\"\nHead teachers' leader Russell Hobby described the changes as \"limited\" and said he did not think heads would be looking to employ unqualified staff.\nThe leader of the National Association of Head Teachers said: \"The vast majority of head teachers will seek out good teachers with QTS, as long as that remains a strong qualification.\"\nOn the conference floor, union member Victor Aguera said: \"This government has turned back the clock to the 1850s and is returning to a 'teacher monitor system'.\n\"Children are being taught on the cheap.

They won't be cut now.\n\"There's no way to see those little abscesses, little tuberculosis lesions without cutting those lymph nodes.\"\nMeat from pigs' heads, is recovered by specialised parts of boning plants and goes into pies, sausages and other processed foods.\nThe new regulations have been drawn up by the European Food Safety Authority, an agency funded by the EU, but they are based on scientific advice from the FSA.\nThe FSA's chief operating officer Andrew Rhodes told the BBC it was better to have a hands-off system using visual checks to reduce cross-contamination, because bugs like E. coli and campylobacter are causing scientists more concern.\nHe said: \"The risks to the consumers are increasingly from microbiological and pathogenic hazards and that's what we must control.\n\"We cannot simply ignore the risks that are brought by touching, cutting and handling products that are later going to go on to be cooked and eaten, we have to do this properly.\"\nBut the FSA's support for the new measures puts them at odds with many of their own frontline staff, the 1,100 meat inspectors who check safety standards in Britain's 350 slaughterhouses and in meat-cutting plants which process carcasses.\nSome in the slaughtering industry are also opposing the changes.\nKevin Burrows, of C and K Meats, owns an abattoir in Suffolk whose main business is pork.\nHe sees the new hands-off approach as \"a backward step\" and says his customers in Asian markets still insist on their pork being checked in the old way, which the FSA has agreed to allow him to do.\nBut he says: \"Why should an exported product be under higher scrutiny than a British product?

Police Commander Lucy D'Orsi was \"seriously, seriously undermined by the Chinese\", according to the Lord Chamberlain, who introduced her to the Queen.\nCommander D'Orsi said it \"was quite a testing time\" and that \"they walked out of Lancaster House and told me that the trip was off\".\nThe Queen clearly knew all about the incident concerned and interjected: \"They were very rude to the ambassador.\"\n\"They walked out on both of us,\" replied Ms D'Orsi.\nDid Ms D'Orsi mean that Chinese officials threatened to cancel the whole state visit? Or just part of the itinerary?\nWas any conflict to do with security arrangements (as Ms D'Orsi was clearly under pressure) or of wider diplomatic significance?\nWe simply do not know. The police have not issued any statement.\nPresident Xi and his wife Madame Peng were guests of the Queen and Prince Philip at Buckingham Palace for the state visit so perhaps it is to be expected that the Queen would be aware of such details.\nThe Metropolitan Police had to defend itself from human rights groups' accusations that it dealt inappropriately with protesters during Mr Xi's visit in October 2015.\nCommander D'Orsi issued a statement in the immediate aftermath of the visit saying she was disappointed at hearing the view expressed that the Met was \"working to the bidding of the Chinese to suppress protest\".\nThe Queen's comments were picked up by the microphone of the camera filming the garden party event, operated by Peter Wilkinson, the monarch's official cameraman\nHis footage was released to broadcasters under the \"pool\" arrangement which is standard procedure for royal events (to avoid all broadcasters sending their own crews to every engagement).\nIt was only then that the uncharacteristically undiplomatic comments were spotted.\nIndeed. At the time Mr Xi said he believed his visit would lift UK-China relations to a \"new height\".\nBuckingham Palace would not comment on a \"private conversation\" but said all parties worked closely to ensure the visit proceeded smoothly.\nChinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lu Kang said the president's trip to the UK was very successful and \"marked the start of the Golden Era between China and the UK\".\nWe now know, thanks to the Queen's comments, that it was a testing time behind the scenes, at least for the police commander and the British ambassador to China.

Gotze - nominally playing as a striker - drifted to find space, allowing Muller to fill the gaps left behind.\nHe scored twice - the first a finish from the edge of the box after dancing past Polish defenders on the left of the penalty area - and also struck the post as he sought to reward Low's loyalty in the face of Pep Guardiola's continuing quandary about how best to accommodate him at Bayern.\nAnd Schweinsteiger, apparently still trying to adjust to the pace of the English Premier League, prowled the midfield, breaking up attacks, starting lightning counter-movements and generally looking majestic.\nIt's no secret. The German side is brimming with talent - and that's without mentioning Toni Kroos or Mesut Ozil!\nOr indeed Manuel Neuer, who produced two out-of-this-world saves to help ensure the three points stayed in Frankfurt.\nBut there or thereabouts lies the merest chink of light for the Scots. For one of those saves was the result of a wayward clearance from the flamboyant keeper.\nAnd he was not the only member of Die Mannschaft to carelessly concede possession or to lose concentration to allow the opposition an opportunity.\nIt happened relatively regularly - sometimes the result of Polish harrying, but on other occasions simply because of a mental or physical lapse by a German player.\nIf Scotland are to take anything from Monday's match, they must surely capitalise on any such failings.\nThe introduction of Hector and Emre Can of Liverpool at full-back looked good from an attacking perspective, but there remains an uncertainty about the German defence.\nHummels and Jerome Boateng are undoubtedly excellent defenders, but if their full-backs are caught high up the pitch they can be vulnerable when dragged out wide.\nThese are scraps, though, on which Scotland must attempt to feed.

He is expected to appeal.\nIt is the first time the ICC has focused on rape as a weapon of war, and the first time a suspect has been convicted over crimes committed by others under his command.\nThe fact that Bemba was convicted for sexual violence is significant. Many Congolese suspects have been accused of such crimes, but this is the first guilty verdict.\nHis conviction was for crimes committed in the Central African Republic, but it will send the message to high-ranking soldiers and militiamen in DR Congo, where sexual violence is rife, that they are responsible for preventing it.\nBut in Congo, despite his murky record, Jean-Pierre Bemba still enjoys significant popularity.\nMembers of his opposition party had hoped he would be released in time to run in the next presidential election, which is scheduled for the end of this year.\nWelcoming the verdict, ICC chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said: \"While the reality of the crimes is appalling, the significance of this decision is to be celebrated.\n\"What this decision affirms is that commanders are responsible for the acts of the forces under their control.\"\nCarrie Comer, from the International Federation for Human Rights, said the verdict was \"a historic moment for victims of such unspeakable atrocities\".\nIt was \"a strong message from ICC judges that commanders must prevent and punish war crimes,\" she wrote on Twitter.\nIt is alleged that for a period of five months Bemba's Movement for the Liberation of Congo (MLC) rebel fighters killed hundred of civilians, raped women and looted.\nThe court heard horrific accounts, including how a man, his wife, his daughters and his granddaughter were all gang-raped by militiamen.\nWho is Jean-Pierre Bemba?\nProfile: Jean-Pierre Bemba\nMore about DR Congo\nBemba's lawyers argued that once the troops had crossed the border they were no longer under his command, but under the then-CAR President Ange-Felix Patasse.\nBut the presiding judge ruled that Bemba had effective control over the troops and was therefore \"criminally responsible\".\nMr Bemba led the MLC during DR Congo's brutal civil war. He is the son of a prominent businessman and a former assistant to ex-Congolese President Mobutu Sese Seko.\nAfter a peace deal in DR Congo in 2003, he laid down his arms and joined an interim government.\nBemba is the most senior figure to face judgement at the court and only the third person to be convicted since the court's founding in 2002.\nGermain Katanga and Thomas Lubanga, both Congolese former warlords, have previously been found guilty of offences.\nWhat does this verdict mean for the ICC?\nThis is a rare success for a beleaguered institution. It is the court's first conviction for rape as a war crime and establishes the principle that commanders are responsible for the actions of their subordinates.\nWhy have there been so few convictions?\nThe cases are often complex and so it takes a long time to go through the evidence. There are also logistical problems such as bringing witnesses from remote areas and organising translators. However, some cases have collapsed, most notably that of Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta.\nWhy are most of its cases in Africa?\nThis is a question African leaders have often asked - they say the many African cases are evidence of discrimination. Critics say leaders such as Mr Kenyatta and Sudan's Omar al-Bashir have used accusations of bias as a smokescreen to evade justice. One former president, Ivory Coast's Laurent Gbagbo, is on trial accused of war crimes.

{"document": "Philip Hammond says the extra money - to be phased in over three years - will help support a system that is \"clearly under pressure\".\nIt comes after months of warnings that services provided by councils for the elderly are under threat because of a lack of funding.\nThe numbers getting help in care homes and in their own homes for daily tasks such as washing and dressing have been falling in recent years.\nThis trend has been blamed for contributing to the growing pressures being seen in the NHS, particularly the rise in visits to A&E.\nSocial care chiefs have said they will need to spend nearly \u00a320bn on services this year.\nBut even when you take into account the extra money being raised from council tax increases and NHS money that is being transferred across, (both previous policy announcements to help out the sector) councils are still nearly \u00a31bn short of what they need.\nBy 2020 that funding gap is predicted to grow to \u00a32.6bn.\nThe money announced in the Budget will go some way to plugging that gap, but clearly not all the way.\nIt is expected to be phased in - with \u00a31bn coming next year and the remaining \u00a31bn spread out over the subsequent two.\nThis will go into a pot shared across both services for the elderly, and those provided to younger adults with disabilities.\nCharities have called it a \"sticking plaster\" to the wider problems facing the sector.\nAlthough, to be fair to the chancellor, he said the extra money would be followed by a green paper later in the year to overhaul the entire system, which has remained largely unchanged since it was created along with the NHS, after the Second World War.\nAbout 500,000 people in England pay the full cost of their care in England. This can prove very expensive.\nOne in 10 people face costs of over \u00a3100,000 once they pass the age of 65.\nAnd there is growing evidence these self-funders are helping to prop up the council-funded side of the market.\nAnalysts LaingBuisson have calculated that the fees councils pay care home firms are \u00a3100 a week below the actual cost of providing the care.\nIts researchers say this shortfall has effectively created a \"hidden care tax\" with self-funders now paying more than 25% extra for the same care.\nTo limit these costs the coalition government announced in 2013 it would be introducing a cap on the cost of care so no-one paid more than \u00a372,000 over their lifetime.\nThis was meant to be introduced in 2016, but that was delayed until 2020. The green paper that was announced in the Budget will set out how - indeed if - that policy will be incorporated into any future changes.\nBut the extra money will do nothing to help these people.\nMore than 4m people over the age of 65 have care needs, but only about 1.35m of them get formal care - either by paying for it themselves or relying on council help.\nWhat happens to the rest? There are 1.5m people who are cared for by family and friends and another 1.2m who struggle by with little or no help.\nIn theory councils could use the extra money to increase the number of people they help.\nBut given there's already a shortfall in funding to maintain the status quo, it seems doubtful this will happen. Again, the promise of longer-term reform remains their best hope.\nThey may also benefit from extra support announced in the Budget for the NHS.\nThere is \u00a3100m extra to help A&Es ahead of next winter and \u00a3325m over the next three years to help with NHS reform by getting local plans off the ground to shift care out of hospitals and into community services.\nEventually this should help boost services such as GPs and district nursing, which the frail elderly are heavy users of. However, given the health budget is currently nearly \u00a3120bn a year, the impact of this extra money will be limited.\nRead more from Nick\nFollow Nick on Twitter", "summary": "The chancellor has announced a \u00a32bn rescue package for the social care sector in England.", "id": "39207593"}
